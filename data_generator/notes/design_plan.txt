DESING PLAN FOR BUILDING A FAIR AND SAFE LOCAITON ENTRY BY USERS

Step 1: Design Plan (What Weâ€™re Building)
Problem:
We want users to either:

Select a known location from dropdowns (continent, country, state, town), OR

Type their location manually if itâ€™s not available.

Typed locations should:

Be saved temporarily.

Not be used for posting until they are approved by the admin.

Step 2: New Model â€” PendingLocation
We'll need a model that holds unapproved user-submitted locations.

Step 3: Modify PersonForm (forms.py)
Weâ€™ll update the form to allow optional text fields for user input if a location isn't in the dropdown:

Step 4: Update views.py for Profile Creation
Now our profile view must check for user-typed entries and save them into PendingLocation:


Refined Workflow With Your Correction
When user submits a location (continent/country/state/town):
User types a location (not selecting from dropdown).

On form submission, for each typed location:

Check if it already exists in the respective table (e.g., Town).

If exists â†’

Use that existing record directly (associate to user profile).

âœ… Allow posting immediately.

Do NOT add a new record.

If does NOT exist â†’

Save the typed value in the PendingLocationRequest linked to the user (without adding to main location tables yet).

ðŸš« Do NOT associate to user profile yet.

ðŸš« User cannot post until admin approves.

Admin reviews PendingLocationRequest:

If admin approves the request, check again if the location already exists:

If exists (maybe added meanwhile), just mark request as approved, and associate that existing location with the user.

If still does NOT exist â†’

Create a new record in the appropriate location table (Continent, Country, State, or Town) with the approved name.

Mark PendingLocationRequest as approved.

Associate this new record with the userâ€™s profile.

After approval and association, the location becomes available to all other users in the dropdown, so they can pick it directly next time.
