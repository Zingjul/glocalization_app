📝 Notes on Staff / Moderator Dashboards

Access URL

Public users → www.example.com

Staff → www.example.com/staff/ or staff.example.com

Access Control

Staff must log in.

Restrict with is_staff or is_superuser.

Normal users who try to enter → 403 Forbidden.

Role-based Permissions

Superuser → full Django admin (/admin/).

Staff / Moderators → custom dashboard (/staff/).

Support staff → limited dashboard (e.g., manage tickets, not users).

Typical Features

Pending posts → approve/reject.

Flagged comments → review/remove.

Manage users → suspend/ban.

Support inbox → handle user issues.

Security Practices

Use 2FA for staff accounts.

Optionally restrict access (VPN / IP whitelist).

Keep audit logs of staff actions.

Implementation Notes

Create a staff app with its own urls.py and views.py.

Decorate views with:

@login_required
@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_staff or u.is_superuser)


Redirect users to the right dashboard based on their role after login.
